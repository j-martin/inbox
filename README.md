# Google Inbox App Packager / Warpper

Convenience native packager for Google Inbox. Uses Electron and is packaged with
[nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) so it
should work on Mac, Windows and Linux.

## Requirement

- nodejs (tested with 5.5)

## Setup

First install the dependencies.

    $ npm install

On OSX you can run the command below

    $ npm run osx

On any other platform you will have to copy the executable/binary manually:

    $ npm run build
